// HTML

// HTML allows you to organize your content
// homepage is always index.html

//* section tag - good for encapsuating related content

//* article tag - similar to section but the content needs to be able to stand on its own. (Like when someone shares an aritle on their web page)

//* div - ONLY for styling and layout purposes

/*
   <element attribute = "value">content</element>
*/

//CSS

//* CSS rule - includes the selector and a declaration block
 /*
    selector {
    declaration block
}
 */

// Three different selectors
//*     1. element selector - refers to the HTML elements ex: p h1 body
//*     2. id selector - #
//*     3. class selector - .

//* Every property in CSS has a default value. Programmers only need to declare the CSS properties they want to change from the default.

//* Order of Precedence - 1st is inline, 2nd is internal, 3rd is external
